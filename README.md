Monitors the Azimuth Encoder and Stepper MCUs
This program connects from a Win10 NUC via usb cables to ftdi and monitors values from the Azimuth Encoder and the dome Stepper drive system
Because the observatory is in a remote physical setting, monitoring physical movements as indicated by the MCUs is a key way to know what's 
going on and what if anything is going wrong...
